const virtues = `# We hold ourselves accountable to the following virtues:

--

## Curiosity Tempered by Purpose

We are creative and curious. We enjoy nothing more than banding together to clear the thick weeds of abstract puzzles. We share a single banner, one that shines purpose on all we do. We are loyal to the glory and honour of creation.

--

## Scrutiny with Sincerity

Curiosity unchecked becomes absurd. We respect every path, but our greatest asset is being able to celebrate our strengths and positively critique our weaknesses. We bring ideas to life in ways that would be impossible alone.

--

## Cultivation and Patience

Mastery is virtuous. It cannot be bought or given, it is cultivated through careful practice. Mastery signals your patience and determination. We strive to be masters of our craft.

--

## Style Points

Remember to collect style points along the way. When you die you'll drop all your gold and items but your style points will be remembered forever. We never forget to season our dishes.`;

const introduction = `# Flex Dapps is the worldâ€™s S-Tier dapp studio. We are a tight-knit group of honest and tenacious humans.

We love building expressive applications and software that delight our global clients and free us from the desperate boredom of living in Australia.

--

We're a sharp tech team who consult, build POCs, MVPs, and stand up tech teams for our mates. We're friendly, curious, and most importantly honest. We have a strong software engineering background, our entire team have been nerds since their early years. If you're looking for a developer-first web3 company, you've found one.

--

We love ideas, but we love the skills to act on those ideas even more. We do what we do because it's fun, and we're really lucky that people want to pay us to do what we enjoy. On this website you'll find the projects we've worked on, our partners and our contact info. If you like our website we probably like you, so don't hesitate to get in touch.
