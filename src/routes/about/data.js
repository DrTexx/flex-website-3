## Curiosity tempered by purpose

We are oh so creative and curious, we love nothing more than solving a mind bending puzzle or game. It's no wonder we sought out the great machines and listened as they whirred and clicked. We realise now that building such machines is game for glory's sake and vow to remain vigilantly focused on building technology that helps humans. Rube Goldberg machines are for weekends.

## Scrutiny with sincerity

To apply our curiousity with purpose we must first reason what is true, then we can aim our pickaxes and drills to yield the oils of enlightenment. We accept that others will plot different, divergent routes on their journey. We respect the rules of all games and respect everyone's chosen path.

##Power levelling with Patience

It is a virtue to master your craft. Mastery cannot be bought or given, it is derived through consistent and careful practice. Mastery signals your patience and determination. We leverage creative tools to work smarter instead of harder every day but we also strive to master them.

##Style points

Remember to collect style points along the way. When you die you'll drop all your gold and items on the ground for other players to pick up but your style points will be remembered forever.

Examples of things that get you style points:

- Building a product that improves people's lives _and_ makes money
- Going to a blockchain week to do a job but winning the hackathon anyway
- Doing things that are outside your comfort zone like Karaoke
- Parkour`;

const introduction = `### Flex Dapps, the worldâ€™s S-Tier dapp developer is a tight-knit team of honest and tenacious humans. 
We love building expressive applications and software that delight our global clients and free us from the desperate boredom of living in Australia. _Just Kidding_, our applications are more than expressive!

We're a sharp tech team who consult, build POCs and MVPs and stand up tech teams for our mates. We're friendly, curious, and most importantly honest. We have a strong software engineering background, our entire team have been nerds since their early years. If you're looking for a developer-first web3 company, you don't need to look any further.

We love ideas but we love the skills to act on those ideas even more. We do what we do because it's fun, and we're really lucky that people want to pay us to do what we enjoy. On this website you'll find the projects we've worked on, our partners and our contact info. If you like our website we probably like you, so don't hesitate to get in touch.
