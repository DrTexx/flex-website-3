const virtues = `# We hold ourselves accountable to the following virtues:

--

## Purposeful Curiosity

We are creative and curious. We enjoy nothing more than solving abstract puzzles. We are loyal to creative freedom our work is the means by which we express that.

--

## Scrutiny with Sincerity

Talk is cheap, which is why we are careful to understand and critique ideas before we execute. When we promise, we deliver; just ask CMAC.

--

## Cultivation and Patience

Mastery cannot be bought or given, it is cultivated through careful and direct practice. We see our work as a craft, and strive to be masters.

--

## Style Points

Remember to collect style points along the way. When you die you'll drop all your gold and items but the stories of your adventures will be remembered forever. Make them count.
